Interpretation:
- Both requests completed without transport error if curl exit codes are 0.
- Endpoint responses remained JSON-shaped with top-level success field.
- If both include expected analysis keys, no obvious cross-request corruption observed.
- Completion timestamps indicate practical latency under concurrent load in this environment.
