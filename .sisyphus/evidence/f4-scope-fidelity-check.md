# F4 Scope Fidelity Check

- Work stayed within backend correctness verification scope.
- No feature implementation, schema migration, or behavior-changing code edits were introduced.
- Changes are limited to evidence artifacts, plan checkbox progression, and verification notes/reporting.
- Environment blockers (missing Caddy binary) were reported with evidence and not silently bypassed.

Result: PASS.
